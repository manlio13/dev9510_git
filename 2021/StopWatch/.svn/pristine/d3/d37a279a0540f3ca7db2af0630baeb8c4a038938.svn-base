Two types of reaction-time tests: Visual and acustic.
The Visual test consist in measuring the time between the appearing of a red spot and your space-bar hitting. Test cicle is of 10 events, 
with random intervals.
The Acustic test is equivalent, with beep sounds.
Note that the value in ms are not accurate as they depends from many
local factors. Then the tests have only a relative value.
